Welcome to by humble "blog".  I'm migrating after quite few years of minimal content on Goggle's Blogger platform, w
as I was constantly fighting to embed code.

At the moment there are tons of great resources, including the indespensible https://stackoverflow.com/, 
however I often run into my own slightly odd issues and I find that documenting my solutions, thoughts, and simply rants
can help my future self if I come across similar issues.

At the moment, GitHub pages seems like the best cross between allowing somewhat custom content (via Jekyll integration), 
so here I am.
