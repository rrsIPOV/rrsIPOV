Welcome to by humble "blog".  I'm migrating after quite few years of minimal content on Goggle's Blogger platform, w
as I was constantly fighting to embed code.

At the moment there are tons of great resources, including the indespensible https://stackoverflow.com/, 
however I often run into my own slightly odd issues and I find that documenting my solutions, thoughts, and simply rants
can help my future self if I come across similar issues.

Currently GitHub pages seems like the best cross between allowing somewhat custom content (via Jekyll integration), 
and and easy setup so here I am.  I've run my own servers and such but for my personal ramblings I'm not 
in the mood any more to experiment.  Plus with the various security threats now, keeping web servers updated 
is a much more fulltime job than when you could just connect an old box up in your dorm room and 
load up FreeBSD.
