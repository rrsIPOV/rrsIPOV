I'm a software enigneer with nearly 20 years of eclectic experience. Despite my experience I haven't settled down into anyone nitche, so 
I find the occasional need to figure out just how the latest framework has reinvented the virtual tire.

I've worked somewhat in Java, Groovy/Grails, Actionscript, Javascript, CSS/SCSS, Typescript, APEX, and various other languages.
